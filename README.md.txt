# OptimizingTrafficLightsWithML
Research project to optimizing traffic signal controller agents with AI and ML. Read FinalReport.pdf for more details. Project code still requires cleaning.

### Brief System Info
System is built in Python 3. All .py files are system components. Define general parameters in main.py. Define genetic parameters in EvolutionaryAlgorithm.py. Use with SUMO traffic simulator (download: http://sumo.sourceforge.net/). 

### To run program
1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed
2. Ensure SUMO is installed with enviornment variables set
3. Set parameters, including GUI on or off in main.py
4. Run command: python main.py
